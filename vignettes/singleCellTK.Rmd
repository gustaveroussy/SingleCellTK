The Single Cell Toolkit (SCTK) is an interactive scRNA-Seq analysis package that
allows a user to upload raw scRNA-Seq count matrices and perform downstream
scRNA-Seq analysis interactively through a web interface, or through a set of
R functions through the command line. The package is written in R with a
graphical user interface (GUI) written in Shiny. Users can perform analysis with
modules for conducting quality control, clustering, batch correction, differential
expression, pathway enrichment, and sample size calculator, all in a simple to
use point and click interface. The toolkit also supports command line data
processing, and results can be loaded into the GUI for additional exploration
and downstream analysis.

# Vignettes

Due to the range of features that are available in SCTK, we have prepared several 
vignettes to help you get started, which are all available at [https://www.camplab.net/sctk/](https://www.camplab.net/sctk/)
