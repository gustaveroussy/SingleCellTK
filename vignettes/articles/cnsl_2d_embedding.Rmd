## Introduction
2D embedding algorithms (tSNE/UMAP) can be run through the **singleCellTK** toolkit using both interactive shiny application and R console. For the interactive analysis, the toolkit offers a streamlined workflow to both compute metrics for embedding and then visualize the results using interactive plots. For the console analysis, the toolkit offers a single wrapper function `runDimReduce` to compute metrics for any of the integrated algorithms. <br>

Methods available with the toolkit include `tSNE` & `UMAP` from `Seurat` [@Butler2018][@Stuart2019][@Satija2017][@Hao2021] package, `tSNE` from `Rtsne` [@Maaten2014][@Maaten2008] package and `UMAP` from `scater` [@McCarthy2017] package. <br> 

To view detailed instructions on how to use these methods, please select 'Interactive Analysis' for using normalization in shiny application or 'Console Analysis' for using these methods on R console from the tabs below: <br>

In general, both sub-tabs offer options for selection of data items and choice of parameters on the left side, and a visualization panel on the right side of the interface. A detailed workflow guide to run and visualize dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms is described below: <br><br>

1. To begin the DR workflow, click on the "Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction" tab from the top menu. This workflow assumes that before proceeding towards computation of DR, data has been uploaded, filtered and normalized (and optionally variable features have been identified) through the preceding tabs.<br><br>

![](ui_screenshots/embedding/dr_1.PNG)<br><br>

2. Select "Embedding" sub-tab: <br><br>

![](ui_screenshots/embedding/e1.png)<br><br>

3. Select a previously stored/computed input matrix to use with the tSNE or UMAP algorithm. <br>
4. Select a specific tSNE or UMAP method for computation. Available methods include tSNE/UMAP from `Seurat` package, tSNE from `rtsne` package and UMAP from `scater` package.<br>
5. Specify a name for the output reduced matrix. <br>
6. Specify if the input matrix should be log-normalized before running the tSNE or UMAP algorithm. It is recommended to select this option if the input matrix selected in step 3 is not log-normalized. <br>

7-11. UMAP specific parameters which may vary between different selected methods in step 3. More information about these parameters is available in method specific documentation. <br>

12. Start computation of selected method with the specified parameters. 
13. Once computation is complete, a scatterplot of the cells on the selected 2D embedding is shown in the panel with additional options available in (14). <br>

![](ui_screenshots/embedding/e2.png)<br><br>

14. Plot specific options can be opened up by clicking on the dropdown button. Users can select another computed embedding to visualize through the plot by clicking on the "Update" button.

In general, the first step is to compute a dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) and then the second
step is to visualize the computed results. The usage of functions to compute and visualize 
results is described below.

**1. Compute dimensionality reduction statistics using `runDimReduce` wrapper function:**
```{r "dm_overview_1", eval = FALSE}
sce <- runDimReduce(inSCE = sce, useAssay = "normalizedCounts", reducedDimName = "redDimUMAP", method = "scaterUMAP", nNeighbors = 30, nIterations = 200, minDist = 0.01, alpha = 1)
```

To use the function, input a `SingleCellExperiment` object that contains the data assay and specify the required parameters (to see a complete list of supported parameters and to copy the function call against each method with the supported parameters, please view the 'Parameters' heading at the end of this page).

***rTSNE***:
```{r "dm_rTSNE_rn", eval = FALSE}
sce <- runDimReduce(inSCE = sce, useAssay = "normalizedCounts", reducedDimName = "redDimTSNE", method = "rTSNE", perplexity = 30, nIterations = 1000)
```

***seuratTSNE***:
```{r "dm_seuratTSNE_rn", eval = FALSE}
sce <- runDimReduce(inSCE = sce, useAssay = "normalizedCounts", reducedDimName = "redDimTSNE", method = "seuratTSNE", nComponents = 10, useReduction = "pca", perplexity = 30)
```

***scaterUMAP***:
```{r "dm_scaterUMAP_rn", eval = FALSE}
sce <- runDimReduce(inSCE = sce, useAssay = "normalizedCounts", reducedDimName = "redDimUMAP", method = "scaterUMAP", nNeighbors = 30, nIterations = 200, minDist = 0.01, alpha = 1)
```

***seuratUMAP***:
```{r "dm_seuratUMAP_rn", eval = FALSE}
sce <- runDimReduce(inSCE = sce, useAssay = "normalizedCounts", reducedDimName = "redDimUMAP", method = "seuratUMAP", nComponents = 10, useReduction = "pca", minDist = 0.3, nNeighbors = 30, spread = 1)
```

**2. Visualize cells as a scatterplot on a 2D embedding (tSNE/UMAP):**
```{r "dm_overview_2", eval=FALSE}
#To plot a simple 2D plot for any of the 4 methods i.e. PCA, ICA, tSNE and UMAP
plotDimRed(inSCE = sce, useReduction = "redDimUMAP", xAxisLabel = "UMAP_1", yAxisLabel = "UMAP_2")
```

  # Perform Normalization
  sce <- runNormalization(inSCE = sce, normalizationMethod = "LogNormalize", useAssay = "counts", outAssayName = "LogNormalizedScaledCounts", scale = TRUE, trim = c(10, -10))
  # Run PCA
  sce <- runDimReduce(inSCE = sce, useAssay = "LogNormalizedScaledCounts", reducedDimName = "redDimPCA", method = "seuratPCA", nComponents = 10)
  # Run UMAP on the PCA reducedDim
  sce <- runDimReduce(inSCE = sce, useReducedDim = "redDimPCA", reducedDimName = "redDimUMAP", method = "scaterUMAP", nNeighbors = 30, nIterations = 200, minDist = 0.5, alpha = 1, spread = 5)
  # Plot UMAP
  plotDimRed(inSCE = sce, useReduction = "redDimUMAP", xAxisLabel = "UMAP_1", yAxisLabel = "UMAP_2")
